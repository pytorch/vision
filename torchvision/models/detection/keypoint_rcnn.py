class KeypointRCNN(FasterRCNN):
    """
    Implements Keypoint R-CNN.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
    image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or evaluation mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (FloatTensor[N, 4]): the ground-truth boxes in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format, with values of x
          between 0 and W and values of y between 0 and H
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the class label for each ground-truth box
        - keypoints (FloatTensor[N, K, 3]): the K keypoints location for each of the N instances, in the
          format [x, y, visibility], where visibility=0 means that the keypoint is not visible.

    The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN, and the keypoint loss.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a List[Dict[Tensor]], one for each input image. The fields of the Dict are as
    follows:
        - boxes (FloatTensor[N, 4]): the predicted boxes in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format, with values of x
          between 0 and W and values of y between 0 and H
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels for each image
        - scores (Tensor[N]): the scores or each prediction
        - keypoints (FloatTensor[N, K, 3]): the locations of the predicted keypoints, in [x, y, v] format.

    Arguments:
        backbone (nn.Module): the network used to compute the features for the model.
            It should contain a out_channels attribute, which indicates the number of output
            channels that each feature map has (and it should be the same for all feature maps).
            The backbone should return a single Tensor or and OrderedDict[Tensor].
        num_classes (int): number of output classes of the model (including the background).
            If box_predictor is specified, num_classes should be None.
        min_size (int): minimum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
        max_size (int): maximum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
        image_mean (Tuple[float, float, float]): mean values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the mean values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained
            on
        image_std (Tuple[float, float, float]): std values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the std values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained on
        rpn_anchor_generator (AnchorGenerator): module that generates the anchors for a set of feature
            maps.

        rpn_fg_iou_thresh (float): minimum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as positive during training of the RPN.
        rpn_bg_iou_thresh (float): maximum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as negative during training of the RPN.
        rpn_batch_size_per_image (int): number of anchors that are sampled during training of the RPN
            for computing the loss
        rpn_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive anchors in a mini-batch during training
            of the RPN

            classification logits and box regression deltas.

            greater than box_score_thresh

            considered as negative during training of the classification head

            classification head
        box_positive_fraction (float): proportion of positive proposals in a mini-batch during training

        keypoint_roi_pool (MultiScaleRoIAlign): the module which crops and resizes the feature maps in
