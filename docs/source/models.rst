Models and pre-trained weights
##############################

The ``torchvision.models`` subpackage contains definitions of models for addressing
different tasks, including: image classification, pixelwise semantic
segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, person
keypoint detection, video classification, and optical flow.

General information on pre-trained weights
==========================================

TorchVision offers pre-trained weights for every provided architecture, using
the PyTorch :mod:`torch.hub`. Instancing a pre-trained model will download its
weights to a cache directory. This directory can be set using the `TORCH_HOME`
environment variable. See :func:`torch.hub.load_state_dict_from_url` for details.

.. note::

    The pre-trained models provided in this library may have their own licenses or
    terms and conditions derived from the dataset used for training. It is your
    responsibility to determine whether you have permission to use the models for
    your use case.

.. note ::
    Backward compatibility is guaranteed for loading a serialized
    ``state_dict`` to the model created using old PyTorch version.
    On the contrary, loading entire saved models or serialized
    ``ScriptModules`` (serialized using older versions of PyTorch)
    may not preserve the historic behaviour. Refer to the following
    `documentation
    <https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/serialization.html#id6>`_


Initializing pre-trained models
-------------------------------

As of v0.13, TorchVision offers a new `Multi-weight support API
<https://pytorch.org/blog/introducing-torchvision-new-multi-weight-support-api/>`_
for loading different weights to the existing model builder methods:

.. code:: python

    from torchvision.models import resnet50, ResNet50_Weights

    # Old weights with accuracy 76.130%
    resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)

    # New weights with accuracy 80.858%
    resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2)

    # Best available weights (currently alias for IMAGENET1K_V2)
    # Note that these weights may change across versions
    resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT)

    # Strings are also supported
    resnet50(weights="IMAGENET1K_V2")

    # No weights - random initialization
    resnet50(weights=None)


Migrating to the new API is very straightforward. The following method calls between the 2 APIs are all equivalent:

.. code:: python

    from torchvision.models import resnet50, ResNet50_Weights

    # Using pretrained weights:
    resnet50(weights=ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V1)
    resnet50(weights="IMAGENET1K_V1")
    resnet50(pretrained=True)  # deprecated
    resnet50(True)  # deprecated

    # Using no weights:
    resnet50(weights=None)
    resnet50()
    resnet50(pretrained=False)  # deprecated
    resnet50(False)  # deprecated

Note that the ``pretrained`` parameter is now deprecated, using it will emit warnings and will be removed on v0.15.

Using the pre-trained models
----------------------------

Before using the pre-trained models, one must preprocess the image
(resize with right resolution/interpolation, apply inference transforms,
rescale the values etc). There is no standard way to do this as it depends on
how a given model was trained. It can vary across model families, variants or
even weight versions. Using the correct preprocessing method is critical and
failing to do so may lead to decreased accuracy or incorrect outputs.

All the necessary information for the inference transforms of each pre-trained
model is provided on its weights documentation. To simplify inference, TorchVision
bundles the necessary preprocessing transforms into each model weight. These are
accessible via the ``weight.transforms`` attribute:

.. code:: python

    # Initialize the Weight Transforms
    weights = ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT
    preprocess = weights.transforms()

    # Apply it to the input image
    img_transformed = preprocess(img)


Some models use modules which have different training and evaluation
behavior, such as batch normalization. To switch between these modes, use
``model.train()`` or ``model.eval()`` as appropriate. See
:meth:`~torch.nn.Module.train` or :meth:`~torch.nn.Module.eval` for details.

.. code:: python

    # Initialize model
    weights = ResNet50_Weights.DEFAULT
    model = resnet50(weights=weights)

    # Set model to eval mode
    model.eval()

Listing and retrieving available models
---------------------------------------

As of v0.14, TorchVision offers a new mechanism which allows listing and
retrieving models and weights by their names. Here are a few examples on how to
use them:

.. code:: python

    # List available models
    all_models = list_models()
    classification_models = list_models(module=torchvision.models)

    # Initialize models
    m1 = get_model("mobilenet_v3_large", weights=None)
    m2 = get_model("quantized_mobilenet_v3_large", weights="DEFAULT")

    # Fetch weights
    weights = get_weight("MobileNet_V3_Large_QuantizedWeights.DEFAULT")
    assert weights == MobileNet_V3_Large_QuantizedWeights.DEFAULT

    weights_enum = get_model_weights("quantized_mobilenet_v3_large")
    assert weights_enum == MobileNet_V3_Large_QuantizedWeights

    weights_enum2 = get_model_weights(torchvision.models.quantization.mobilenet_v3_large)
    assert weights_enum == weights_enum2

Here are the available public functions to retrieve models and their corresponding weights:

.. currentmodule:: torchvision.models
.. autosummary::
    :toctree: generated/
    :template: function.rst

    get_model
    get_model_weights
    get_weight
    list_models

Using models from Hub
---------------------

Most pre-trained models can be accessed directly via PyTorch Hub without having TorchVision installed:

.. code:: python

    import torch

    # Option 1: passing weights param as string
    model = torch.hub.load("pytorch/vision", "resnet50", weights="IMAGENET1K_V2")

    # Option 2: passing weights param as enum
    weights = torch.hub.load(
        "pytorch/vision",
        "get_weight",
        weights="ResNet50_Weights.IMAGENET1K_V2",
    )
    model = torch.hub.load("pytorch/vision", "resnet50", weights=weights)

You can also retrieve all the available weights of a specific model via PyTorch Hub by doing:

.. code:: python

    import torch

    weight_enum = torch.hub.load("pytorch/vision", "get_model_weights", name="resnet50")
    print([weight for weight in weight_enum])

The only exception to the above are the detection models included on
:mod:`torchvision.models.detection`. These models require TorchVision
to be installed because they depend on custom C++ operators.
