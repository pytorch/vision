This can be\nuseful e.g. if you want to associate a path with every single sample when\ndebugging!\n\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\"><h4>Note</h4><p>**Disclaimer** This note is slightly advanced and can be safely skipped on\n    a first read.\n\n    Pure :class:`torch.Tensor` objects are, in general, treated as images (or\n    as videos for video-specific transforms). Indeed, you may have noticed\n    that in the code above we haven't used the\n    :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image` class at all, and yet our images\n    got transformed properly. Transforms follow the following logic to\n    determine whether a pure Tensor should be treated as an image (or video),\n    or just ignored:\n\n    * If there is an :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image`,\n      :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Video`,\n      or :class:`PIL.Image.Image` instance in the input, all other pure\n      tensors are passed-through.\n    * If there is no :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image` or\n      :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Video` instance, only the first pure\n      :class:`torch.Tensor` will be transformed as image or video, while all\n      others will be passed-through. Here \"first\" means \"first in a depth-wise\n      traversal\".\n\n    This is what happened in the detection example above: the first pure\n    tensor was the image so it got transformed properly, and all other pure\n    tensor instances like the ``labels`` were passed-through (although labels\n    can still be transformed by some transforms like\n    :class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.SanitizeBoundingBoxes`!).</p></div>\n\n\n## Transforms and Datasets intercompatibility\n\nRoughly speaking, the output of the datasets must correspond to the input of\nthe transforms. How to do that depends on whether you're using the torchvision\n`built-in datatsets <datasets>`, or your own custom datasets.\n\n### Using built-in datasets\n\nIf you're just doing image classification, you don't need to do anything. Just\nuse ``transform`` argument of the dataset e.g. ``ImageNet(...,\ntransform=transforms)`` and you're good to go.\n\nTorchvision also supports datasets for object detection or segmentation like\n:class:`torchvision.datasets.CocoDetection`. Those datasets predate\nthe existence of the :mod:`torchvision.transforms.v2` module and of the\nTVTensors, so they don't return TVTensors out of the box.\n\nAn easy way to force those datasets to return TVTensors and to make them\ncompatible with v2 transforms is to use the\n:func:`torchvision.datasets.wrap_dataset_for_transforms_v2` function:\n\n```python\nfrom torchvision.datasets import CocoDetection, wrap_dataset_for_transforms_v2\n\ndataset = CocoDetection(..., transforms=my_transforms)\ndataset = wrap_dataset_for_transforms_v2(dataset)\n# Now the dataset returns TVTensors!\n```\n### Using your own datasets\n\nIf you have a custom dataset, then you'll need to convert your objects into\nthe appropriate TVTensor classes. Creating TVTensor instances is very easy,\nrefer to `tv_tensor_creation` for more details.\n\nThere are two main places where you can implement that conversion logic:\n\n- At the end of the datasets's ``__getitem__`` method, before returning the\n  sample (or by sub-classing the dataset).\n- As the very first step of your transforms pipeline\n\nEither way, the logic will depend on your specific dataset.\n\n"
