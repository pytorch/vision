GoogLeNet
=========

.. currentmodule:: torchvision.models

The GoogleNet model is based on the `Going Deeper with Convolutions <https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842>`__
paper.


Model builders
--------------

The following model builders can be used to instantiate a GoogLeNet model, with or
without pre-trained weights. All the model builders internally rely on the
``torchvision.models.googlenet.GoogLeNet`` base class. Please refer to the `source
code
<https://github.com/pytorch/vision/blob/main/torchvision/models/googlenet.py>`_ for
more details about this class.
