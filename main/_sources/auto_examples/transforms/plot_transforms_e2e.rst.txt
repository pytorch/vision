Transforms v2: End-to-end object detection/segmentation example
===============================================================

.. note::
    Try on `collab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/vision/blob/gh-pages/main/_generated_ipynb_notebooks/plot_transforms_e2e.ipynb>`_
    or :ref:`go to the end <sphx_glr_download_auto_examples_transforms_plot_transforms_e2e.py>` to download the full example code.

Object detection and segmentation tasks are natively supported:
``torchvision.transforms.v2`` enables jointly transforming images, videos,
bounding boxes, and masks.

This example showcases an end-to-end instance segmentation training case using
Torchvision utils from ``torchvision.datasets``, ``torchvision.models`` and
``torchvision.transforms.v2``. Everything covered here can be applied similarly
to object detection or semantic segmentation tasks.

Dataset preparation
-------------------

We start off by loading the :class:`~torchvision.datasets.CocoDetection` dataset to have a look at what it currently
returns.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 47-55

.. code-block:: Python


    dataset = datasets.CocoDetection(IMAGES_PATH, ANNOTATIONS_PATH)

    sample = dataset[0]
    img, target = sample
    print(f"{type(img) = }\n{type(target) = }\n{type(target[0]) = }\n{target[0].keys() = }")

Torchvision datasets preserve the data structure and types as it was intended
by the datasets authors. So by default, the output structure may not always be
compatible with the models or the transforms.

To overcome that, we can use the
:func:`~torchvision.datasets.wrap_dataset_for_transforms_v2` function. For
:class:`~torchvision.datasets.CocoDetection`, this changes the target
structure to a single dictionary of lists:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 64-72

.. code-block:: Python


    dataset = datasets.wrap_dataset_for_transforms_v2(dataset, target_keys=("boxes", "labels", "masks"))

    sample = dataset[0]
    img, target = sample
    print(f"{type(img) = }\n{type(target) = }\n{target.keys() = }")
    print(f"{type(target['boxes']) = }\n{type(target['labels']) = }\n{type(target['masks']) = }")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    type(img) = <class 'PIL.Image.Image'>
    type(target) = <class 'dict'>
    target.keys() = dict_keys(['boxes', 'masks', 'labels'])
    type(target['boxes']) = <class 'torchvision.tv_tensors._bounding_boxes.BoundingBoxes'>
    type(target['labels']) = <class 'torch.Tensor'>
    type(target['masks']) = <class 'torchvision.tv_tensors._mask.Mask'>




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 73-87

We used the ``target_keys`` parameter to specify the kind of output we're
interested in. Our dataset now returns a target which is dict where the values
are :ref:`TVTensors <what_are_tv_tensors>` (all are :class:`torch.Tensor`
subclasses). We're dropped all unncessary keys from the previous output, but
if you need any of the original keys e.g. "image_id", you can still ask for
it.

.. note::

    If you just want to do detection, you don't need and shouldn't pass
    "masks" in ``target_keys``: if masks are present in the sample, they will
    be transformed, slowing down your transformations unnecessarily.

As baseline, let's have a look at a sample without transformations:

Transforms
----------

Let's now define our pre-processing transforms. All the transforms know how
to handle images, bouding boxes and masks when relevant.

Transforms are typically passed as the ``transforms`` parameter of the
dataset so that they can leverage multi-processing from the
:class:`torch.utils.data.DataLoader`.

    transforms = v2.Compose(
        [
            v2.ToImage(),
            v2.RandomPhotometricDistort(p=1),
            v2.RandomZoomOut(fill={tv_tensors.Image: (123, 117, 104), "others": 0}),
            v2.RandomIoUCrop(),
            v2.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=1),
            v2.SanitizeBoundingBoxes(),
            v2.ToDtype(torch.float32, scale=True),
        ]
    )

A few things are worth noting here:

- We're converting the PIL image into a
  :class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.Image` object. This isn't strictly
  necessary, but relying on Tensors (here: a Tensor subclass) will
  :ref:`generally be faster <transforms_perf>`.
- We are calling :class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.SanitizeBoundingBoxes` to
  make sure we remove degenerate bounding boxes, as well as their
  corresponding labels and masks.
  :class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.SanitizeBoundingBoxes` should be placed
  at least once at the end of a detection pipeline; it is particularly
  critical if :class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.RandomIoUCrop` was used.

Let's look how the sample looks like with our augmentation pipeline in place:

   :class: sphx-glr-single-img





.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 138-147

We can see that the color of the images were distorted, zoomed in or out, and flipped.
The bounding boxes and the masks were transformed accordingly. And without any further ado, we can start training.

Data loading and training loop
------------------------------

Below we're using Mask-RCNN which is an instance segmentation model, but
everything we've covered in this tutorial also applies to object detection and
semantic segmentation tasks.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 147-170

.. code-block:: Python


    data_loader = torch.utils.data.DataLoader(
        dataset,
        batch_size=2,
        # We need a custom collation function here, since the object detection
        # models expect a sequence of images and target dictionaries. The default
        # collation function tries to torch.stack() the individual elements,
        # which fails in general for object detection, because the number of bouding
        # boxes varies between the images of a same batch.
        collate_fn=lambda batch: tuple(zip(*batch)),
    )

    model = models.get_model("maskrcnn_resnet50_fpn_v2", weights=None, weights_backbone=None).train()

    for imgs, targets in data_loader:
        loss_dict = model(imgs, targets)
        # Put your training logic here

        print(f"{[img.shape for img in imgs] = }")
        print(f"{[type(target) for target in targets] = }")
        for name, loss_val in loss_dict.items():
            print(f"{name:<20}{loss_val:.3f}")

Training References
-------------------

From there, you can check out the `torchvision references
<https://github.com/pytorch/vision/tree/main/references>`_ where you'll find
the actual training scripts we use to train our models.

**Disclaimer** The code in our references is more complex than what you'll
need for your own use-cases: this is because we're supporting different
backends (PIL, tensors, TVTensors) and different transforms namespaces (v1 and
v2). So don't be afraid to simplify and only keep what you need.
