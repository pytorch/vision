TVTensors are Tensor subclasses introduced together with
``torchvision.transforms.v2``. This example showcases what these TVTensors are
and how they behave.

.. warning::

    **Intended Audience** Unless you're writing your own transforms or your own TVTensors, you
    probably do not need to read this guide. This is a fairly low-level topic
    that most users will not need to worry about: you do not need to understand
    the internals of TVTensors to efficiently rely on
    ``torchvision.transforms.v2``. It may however be useful for advanced users
    trying to implement their own datasets, transforms, or work directly with
    the TVTensors.

What are TVTensors?
-------------------

TVTensors are zero-copy tensor subclasses:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 38-45

.. code-block:: default


    tensor = torch.rand(3, 256, 256)
    image = tv_tensors.Image(tensor)

    assert isinstance(image, torch.Tensor)
    assert image.data_ptr() == tensor.data_ptr()








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 46-63

Under the hood, they are needed in :mod:`torchvision.transforms.v2` to correctly dispatch to the appropriate function
for the input data.

:mod:`torchvision.tv_tensors` supports four types of TVTensors:

* :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image`
* :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Video`
* :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes`
* :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Mask`

What can I do with a TVTensor?
------------------------------

TVTensors look and feel just like regular tensors - they **are** tensors.
Everything that is supported on a plain :class:`torch.Tensor` like ``.sum()`` or
any ``torch.*`` operator will also work on TVTensors. See
:ref:`tv_tensor_unwrapping_behaviour` for a few gotchas.

.. _tv_tensor_creation:

How do I construct a TVTensor?
------------------------------

Using the constructor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each TVTensor class takes any tensor-like data that can be turned into a :class:`~torch.Tensor`

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 74-79

.. code-block:: default


    image = tv_tensors.Image([[[[0, 1], [1, 0]]]])
    print(image)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Image([[[[0, 1],
             [1, 0]]]], )




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 80-82

Similar to other PyTorch creations ops, the constructor also takes the ``dtype``, ``device``, and ``requires_grad``
parameters.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 82-87

.. code-block:: default


    float_image = tv_tensors.Image([[[0, 1], [1, 0]]], dtype=torch.float32, requires_grad=True)
    print(float_image)






.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Image([[[0., 1.],
            [1., 0.]]], grad_fn=<AliasBackward0>, )




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-90

In addition, :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image` and :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Mask` can also take a
:class:`PIL.Image.Image` directly:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 90-94

.. code-block:: default


    image = tv_tensors.Image(PIL.Image.open("../assets/astronaut.jpg"))
    print(image.shape, image.dtype)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    torch.Size([3, 512, 512]) torch.uint8




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 95-99

Some TVTensors require additional metadata to be passed in ordered to be constructed. For example,
:class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes` requires the coordinate format as well as the size of the
corresponding image (``canvas_size``) alongside the actual values. These
metadata are required to properly transform the bounding boxes.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 99-107

.. code-block:: default


    bboxes = tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes(
        [[17, 16, 344, 495], [0, 10, 0, 10]],
        format=tv_tensors.BoundingBoxFormat.XYXY,
        canvas_size=image.shape[-2:]
    )
    print(bboxes)





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    BoundingBoxes([[ 17,  16, 344, 495],
                   [  0,  10,   0,  10]], format=BoundingBoxFormat.XYXY, canvas_size=torch.Size([512, 512]))




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 108-115

Using ``tv_tensors.wrap()``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can also use the :func:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.wrap` function to wrap a tensor object
into a TVTensor. This is useful when you already have an object of the
desired type, which typically happens when writing transforms: you just want
to wrap the output like the input.

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 115-121

.. code-block:: default


    new_bboxes = torch.tensor([0, 20, 30, 40])
    new_bboxes = tv_tensors.wrap(new_bboxes, like=bboxes)
    assert isinstance(new_bboxes, tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes)
    assert new_bboxes.canvas_size == bboxes.canvas_size








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 122-132

The metadata of ``new_bboxes`` is the same as ``bboxes``, but you could pass
it as a parameter to override it.

.. _tv_tensor_unwrapping_behaviour:

I had a TVTensor but now I have a Tensor. Help!
-----------------------------------------------

By default, operations on :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.TVTensor` objects
will return a pure Tensor:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 132-142

.. code-block:: default



    assert isinstance(bboxes, tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes)

    # Shift bboxes by 3 pixels in both H and W
    new_bboxes = bboxes + 3

    assert isinstance(new_bboxes, torch.Tensor)
    assert not isinstance(new_bboxes, tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 143-149

.. note::

   This behavior only affects native ``torch`` operations. If you are using
   the built-in ``torchvision`` transforms or functionals, you will always get
   as output the same type that you passed as input (pure ``Tensor`` or
   ``TVTensor``).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 151-157

But I want a TVTensor back!
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can re-wrap a pure tensor into a TVTensor by just calling the TVTensor
constructor, or by using the :func:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.wrap` function
(see more details above in :ref:`tv_tensor_creation`):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 157-162

.. code-block:: default


    new_bboxes = bboxes + 3
    new_bboxes = tv_tensors.wrap(new_bboxes, like=bboxes)
    assert isinstance(new_bboxes, tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 163-166

Alternatively, you can use the :func:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.set_return_type`
as a global config setting for the whole program, or as a context manager
(read its docs to learn more about caveats):

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 166-171

.. code-block:: default


    with tv_tensors.set_return_type("TVTensor"):
        new_bboxes = bboxes + 3
    assert isinstance(new_bboxes, tv_tensors.BoundingBoxes)








.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 172-211

Why is this happening?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**For performance reasons**. :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.TVTensor`
classes are Tensor subclasses, so any operation involving a
:class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.TVTensor` object will go through the
`__torch_function__
<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/extending.html#extending-torch>`_
protocol. This induces a small overhead, which we want to avoid when possible.
This doesn't matter for built-in ``torchvision`` transforms because we can
avoid the overhead there, but it could be a problem in your model's
``forward``.

**The alternative isn't much better anyway.** For every operation where
preserving the :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.TVTensor` type makes
sense, there are just as many operations where returning a pure Tensor is
preferable: for example, is ``img.sum()`` still an :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image`?
If we were to preserve :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.TVTensor` types all
the way, even model's logits or the output of the loss function would end up
being of type :class:`~torchvision.tv_tensors.Image`, and surely that's not
desirable.

.. note::

   This behaviour is something we're actively seeking feedback on. If you find this surprising or if you
   have any suggestions on how to better support your use-cases, please reach out to us via this issue:
   https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/7319

Exceptions
^^^^^^^^^^

There are a few exceptions to this "unwrapping" rule:
:meth:`~torch.Tensor.clone`, :meth:`~torch.Tensor.to`,
:meth:`torch.Tensor.detach`, and :meth:`~torch.Tensor.requires_grad_` retain
the TVTensor type.

Inplace operations on TVTensors like ``obj.add_()`` will preserve the type of
``obj``. However, the **returned** value of inplace operations will be a pure
tensor:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 211-225

.. code-block:: default


    image = tv_tensors.Image([[[0, 1], [1, 0]]])

    new_image = image.add_(1).mul_(2)

    # image got transformed in-place and is still a TVTensor Image, but new_image
    # is a Tensor. They share the same underlying data and they're equal, just
    # different classes.
    assert isinstance(image, tv_tensors.Image)
    print(image)

    assert isinstance(new_image, torch.Tensor) and not isinstance(new_image, tv_tensors.Image)
    assert (new_image == image).all()
    assert new_image.data_ptr() == image.data_ptr()
