How to use CutMix and MixUp
===========================

.. note::
    Try on `Colab <https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/vision/blob/gh-pages/main/_generated_ipynb_notebooks/plot_cutmix_mixup.ipynb>`_
    or :ref:`go to the end <sphx_glr_download_auto_examples_transforms_plot_cutmix_mixup.py>` to download the full example code.

:class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.CutMix` and
:class:`~torchvision.transforms.v2.MixUp` are popular augmentation strategies
that can improve classification accuracy.

These transforms are slightly different from the rest of the Torchvision
transforms, because they expect
**batches** of samples as input, not individual images. In this example we'll
explain how to use them: after the ``DataLoader``, or as part of a collation
function.

Pre-processing pipeline
-----------------------

We'll use a simple but typical image classification pipeline:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 35-49

.. code-block:: Python


    preproc = v2.Compose([
        v2.PILToTensor(),
        v2.RandomResizedCrop(size=(224, 224), antialias=True),
        v2.RandomHorizontalFlip(p=0.5),
        v2.ToDtype(torch.float32, scale=True),  # to float32 in [0, 1]
        v2.Normalize(mean=(0.485, 0.456, 0.406), std=(0.229, 0.224, 0.225)),  # typically from ImageNet
    ])

    dataset = FakeData(size=1000, num_classes=NUM_CLASSES, transform=preproc)

    img, label = dataset[0]
    print(f"{type(img) = }, {img.dtype = }, {img.shape = }, {label = }")





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    type(img) = <class 'torch.Tensor'>, img.dtype = torch.float32, img.shape = torch.Size([3, 224, 224]), label = 67




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 50-54

One important thing to note is that neither CutMix nor MixUp are part of this
pre-processing pipeline. We'll add them a bit later once we define the
DataLoader. Just as a refresher, this is what the DataLoader and training loop
would look like if we weren't using CutMix or MixUp:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 55-65

.. code-block:: Python


    from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

    for images, labels in dataloader:
        print(f"{images.shape = }, {labels.shape = }")
        print(labels.dtype)
        # <rest of the training loop here>
        break




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    images.shape = torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]), labels.shape = torch.Size([4])
    torch.int64

Where to use MixUp and CutMix
-----------------------------

After the DataLoader
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now let's add CutMix and MixUp. The simplest way to do this right after the
DataLoader: the Dataloader has already batched the images and labels for us,
and this is exactly what these transforms expect as input:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 77-91

.. code-block:: Python


    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True)

    cutmix = v2.CutMix(num_classes=NUM_CLASSES)
    mixup = v2.MixUp(num_classes=NUM_CLASSES)
    cutmix_or_mixup = v2.RandomChoice([cutmix, mixup])

    for images, labels in dataloader:
        print(f"Before CutMix/MixUp: {images.shape = }, {labels.shape = }")
        images, labels = cutmix_or_mixup(images, labels)
        print(f"After CutMix/MixUp: {images.shape = }, {labels.shape = }")

        # <rest of the training loop here>
        break




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    Before CutMix/MixUp: images.shape = torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]), labels.shape = torch.Size([4])
    After CutMix/MixUp: images.shape = torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]), labels.shape = torch.Size([4, 100])




.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 92-106

Note how the labels were also transformed: we went from a batched label of
shape (batch_size,) to a tensor of shape (batch_size, num_classes). The
transformed labels can still be passed as-is to a loss function like
:func:`torch.nn.functional.cross_entropy`.

As part of the collation function
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Passing the transforms after the DataLoader is the simplest way to use CutMix
and MixUp, but one disadvantage is that it does not take advantage of the
DataLoader multi-processing. For that, we can pass those transforms as part of
the collation function (refer to the `PyTorch docs
<https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html#dataloader-collate-fn>`_ to learn
more about collation).

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 107-123

.. code-block:: Python


    from torch.utils.data import default_collate


    def collate_fn(batch):
        return cutmix_or_mixup(*default_collate(batch))


    dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=4, shuffle=True, num_workers=2, collate_fn=collate_fn)

    for images, labels in dataloader:
        print(f"{images.shape = }, {labels.shape = }")
        # No need to call cutmix_or_mixup, it's already been called as part of the DataLoader!
        # <rest of the training loop here>
        break





.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    images.shape = torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]), labels.shape = torch.Size([4, 100])

Non-standard input format
-------------------------

So far we've used a typical sample structure where we pass ``(images,
labels)`` as inputs. MixUp and CutMix will magically work by default with most
common sample structures: tuples where the second parameter is a tensor label,
or dict with a "label[s]" key. Look at the documentation of the
``labels_getter`` parameter for more details.

If your samples have a different structure, you can still use CutMix and MixUp
by passing a callable to the ``labels_getter`` parameter. For example:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 135-151

.. code-block:: Python


    batch = {
        "imgs": torch.rand(4, 3, 224, 224),
        "target": {
            "classes": torch.randint(0, NUM_CLASSES, size=(4,)),
            "some_other_key": "this is going to be passed-through"
        }
    }


    def labels_getter(batch):
        return batch["target"]["classes"]


    out = v2.CutMix(num_classes=NUM_CLASSES, labels_getter=labels_getter)(batch)
    print(f"{out['imgs'].shape = }, {out['target']['classes'].shape = }")




.. rst-class:: sphx-glr-script-out

 .. code-block:: none

    out['imgs'].shape = torch.Size([4, 3, 224, 224]), out['target']['classes'].shape = torch.Size([4, 100])
